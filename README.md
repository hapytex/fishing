# üé£ Fishing

A set of functions for the **F**riendly **I**nteractive **Sh**ell (fish). This is mainly made for a programmer in Haskell and Python, so it has some programs to make the Haskell stack and Python shell more convenient. Furthermore there are some functions for astronomy like the phase of the moon.

## Installation

One can install this by downloading (or cloning) and put the files in the `~/.config/fish/functions/`
directory.

You can of course also clone this repository at that location and thus *pull* new changes directly to the configuration directory:

```bash
git clone github.com/hapytex/fishing.git ~/.config/fish/functions/
```
